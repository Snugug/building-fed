## Urgency
* General sense of uneasiness amongst FEDs in Design org
* One FED conducted a a little research
  * Neither Design nor Engineering understood FED as a unique skillset that encompassed both
  * On Design teams, many did general Design work
  * When developing, many found that Engineering didn't view them as "real developers"; designers who had never work with "enterprise" code.
  * FEDs in Design often viewed Engineering developers as out-of-date with modern tools, techniques, and best practices
* Wound up creating lots of tension and frustration.

## Lead
* Leadership started with local practitioners who had some localized powere before FED@IBM existed
* Una Kravets started an Austin-local p2p knowledge sharing called FED Date
* Kevin Suttle and I were FED leaders in our BUs and started a virtual Slack community
* Jessica Trembly put together a twice-a-month lunch-and-learn FEDucation
* January 2015, Phil Gilbert, GM of Design, empowered FEDucation as an official Design program, funding it
* April of 2015, Damon Deaner was appointed as a member of IBM Design leadership specifically to guide the global FED community, something unique to this community

## Vision
* Vision from the beginning
  * Work with modern tools, techniques, and best-practices while shipping UI code to production
* Need for BUs to acknowledge FED as unique skills set and career path w/specialists
* Interesting: All of us had more or less the same vision w/o needing to talk about it.
* Values around craft been shaped by similar principles, especially Social Coding and Open Source, so not much discussion needed

## Actions
* FED Date allows devs to share what's new and hot, or cool projects
* FEDucation provides 2x month education around FED to global community based on our vision, even bringing in outside experts (Alex Russell, Sarah Drasner, GitHub, ZenHub, O'Reilly Media) and people outside the FED@IBM community at IBM
* Hackademy to bring our vision into a training for our worldwide community

## Empower
* FED Date, FEDucation, and Hackademy all are enablement programs to empower our devs with new knowledge.
* Fed 101 was started by FEDs to expand FED knowledge to Designers and Engineers across our studios to teach basics of FED
* Hackademy travels the world to physically enable people.
* FED@IBM is building a career path specifically for FEDs
* Whitewater team has been invaluable to empower our work. FED@IBM has been essential at pushing for new tooling at IBM, like Slack, GitHub Enterprise, Safari Online, and many others.

## Small Wins
* FED Date was first. Quick, persistent, 0 cost enablement
* FEDUcation becoming sanctioned and funded was a big quick win, showing material support to the transformation

## Bigger Wins

* Led to FED week at our New Hire program which led to FED 101
* After 6 months, momentum had built to allow a trial of Hackademy which was successful enough that we've run 11 globally in 14 months

## Culture
* Social Coding, GHE, self-serve CI/CD, Slack, Agile.
* Tools and practices being adopted at scale across IBM and heralded as the new way to work all explicitly support the culture we want
* Our vision is closely intertwined with modern practices, therefore sets up as leaders of the new culture
